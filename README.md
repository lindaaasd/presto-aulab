## About Presto.it

<h3> The final project I worked on for the graduation of the coding bootcamp AULAB, for Full Stack Web Developers </h3>

<p> This whole website was done in two weeks, using two-day sprints and the Pomodoro method </p>
<p> We worked in Laravel 8 Framework, using PHP </p>
<p> For the front end layout, we used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap Javascript and jQuery </p>

<h4> Back end functionalities </h4>

<p> We used Laravel Fortify for the authentication / registration, also added the contact option via mail set-up. </p>
<p> The website is one filled with ads uploaded by a user, that's why we also created a Revisor role functionality </p>
<p> You can use the search bar to find all ads within the website and you can also filter them by category. </p>
<p> Dropzone was implemented in order to grant the possibility to add more than one photo. </p>
<p> Spatie library from Laravel was used to resize the uploaded images. </p>
<p> Eventually, we installed Google Vision APIs and with it, we can also add a watermark. Also, thanks to Google Vision AI we can check if the images uploaded have sensitive or offensive content and we can also blur faces </p>
